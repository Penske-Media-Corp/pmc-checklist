Quickly make a checklist out of an unordered list.

== Description ==
Add a CSS class to an unordered list in the post body and this plugin will turn it into a checklist (with checkboxes). Checked boxes do not persist (does not save), useful for just jotting things down once.

== Changelog ==
1.0 - Initial version
